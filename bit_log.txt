Certainly! Here’s a list of some of the most important court cases related to prisoners’ rights in the United States, along with brief explanations:

### 1. **Ex parte Hull (1941)**
   - **Significance:** Established that prisons cannot block inmates’ access to courts or refuse to allow them to file habeas corpus petitions.
   - **Key Principle:** Prisoners have a fundamental right to access courts.

### 2. **Wolff v. McDonnell (1974)**
   - **Significance:** Held that prisoners are entitled to some due process protections in disciplinary proceedings (like advance written notice, the opportunity to call witnesses, and a fair hearing).
   - **Key Principle:** Due process applies, though often in a limited form, within prisons.

### 3. **Procunier v. Martinez (1974)**
   - **Significance:** Recognized prisoners’ First Amendment rights regarding correspondence; prison authorities must have a legitimate interest to censor mail.
   - **Key Principle:** Free speech applies to prisoners, within limits.

### 4. **Estelle v. Gamble (1976)**
   - **Significance:** Established that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners violates the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
   - **Key Principle:** Prisoners have a right to medical care.

### 5. **Bounds v. Smith (1977)**
   - **Significance:** Affirmed prisoners’ right of access to the courts, requiring prisons to provide law libraries or legal assistance.
   - **Key Principle:** Access to legal resources is essential.

### 6. **Bell v. Wolfish (1979)**
   - **Significance:** Upheld policies in pretrial detention, noting that not all discomfort amounts to unconstitutional punishment; outlined balancing test of prisoner rights vs. institution security.
   - **Key Principle:** Reasonableness of restrictions is weighed against security needs.

### 7. **Turner v. Safley (1987)**
   - **Significance:** Developed a standard for when prison regulations infringing on constitutional rights are permissible. Restrictions must be "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”
   - **Key Principle:** Turner test—the standard for evaluating prisoners’ constitutional claims.

### 8. **Hudson v. Palmer (1984)**
   - **Significance:** Held that prisoners have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their cells; allowed routine searches without a warrant.
   - **Key Principle:** Limited Fourth Amendment protections in prison.

### 9. **Hudson v. McMillian (1992)**
   - **Significance:** Established that use of excessive physical force against prisoners, even without a serious injury, can constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.
   - **Key Principle:** Protection from excessive force.

### 10. **Farmer v. Brennan (1994)**
   - **Significance:** Prison officials may be liable under the Eighth Amendment for acting with “deliberate indifference” to inmates’ health or safety.
   - **Key Principle:** Deliberate indifference standard clarified.

### 11. **Lewis v. Casey (1996)**
   - **Significance:** Clarified that Bounds v. Smith does not guarantee prisoners the right to a library, only the right to petition the courts. Any lack of access must show “actual injury.”
   - **Key Principle:** Actual injury requirement for access-to-courts claims.

**Honorable Mention:**
- **Johnson v. California (2005):** Held that strict racial segregation in prisons is subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, even for short-term housing assignments.
